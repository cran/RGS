Description: Provides a recursive gradient scanning algorithm for
    discretizing continuous variables in Logistic and Cox regression
    models. This algorithm is especially effective in identifying
    optimal cut-points for variables with U-shaped relationships to
    'lnOR' (the natural logarithm of the odds ratio) or 'lnHR' (the
    natural logarithm of the hazard ratio), thereby enhancing model
    fit, interpretability, and predictive power. By iteratively
    scanning and calculating gradient changes, the method accurately
    pinpoints critical cut-points within nonlinear relationships,
    transforming continuous variables into categorical ones. This
    approach improves risk classification and regression analysis
    performance, increasing interpretability and practical relevance
    in clinical and risk management settings.
